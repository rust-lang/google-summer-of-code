# Google Summer of Code
The Rust Project has been participating in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program since 2024.

Runs:
- **2025**: [accepted projects](runs/2025.md), [blog post announcement](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/05/08/gsoc-2025-selected-projects), [results](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/11/18/gsoc-2025-results).
- **2024**: [accepted projects](runs/2024.md), [blog post announcement](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/05/01/gsoc-2024-selected-projects.html), [results](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/11/07/gsoc-2024-results.html).

If you would like to participate in GSoC, please take a look at the [proposal guide](proposal-guide.md), which should help you prepare your GSoC proposals.

**Please do not harrass and/or spam Rust Project members and mentors, or other members of the Rust community! If you do so, we will not consider your proposal. It is fine to send a direct message (DM) to a mentor that you want to communicate with, but do not spam multiple people with DMs, asking them to be a mentor for your project proposal! Post a topic in some Zulip stream instead.**

## AI policy
In general, please examine the [Guidance for GSoC Contributors using AI tooling in GSoC 2026](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t9GcIBnNXPNO6klRQvU8pL8-uV6afzLo6JUAM299suA) by Google and try to abide by its recommendations. We provide more recommendations on using AI for writing proposals and sending code contributions below. The TLDR is:

- Do not use AI to generate proposal text.
- If you use AI for your code contributions, let your mentor know about it and ensure that you fully understand the generated code.

**Remember, we are interested in seeing *your work* and *your thinking*, since *you* are applying to do the project — not the AI!**

### Proposals
We would appreciate if you used your own words when writing GSoC project proposals. It is fine to use LLMs/AI for spellcheck, language correction or translation, but do not rely on AI to write the proposal for you. We will ignore proposals that look like they were *generated* by AI. Please don't submit AI-generated proposals! They won't be accepted, and will just create additional work for us.

### Code contributions
For your code contributions, we would appreciate if you disclosed to your mentor if and how you use AI for non-trivial tasks. In particular, if you *generate* code using AI, you should let your mentor know about that. Note that you are still responsible for all the code that you produce and you should understand how it works.

## Hardware access
The Rust Project can provide remote access to powerful cloud-based [Linux machines](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/docs/dev-desktop.html) to contributors that will be accepted for a GSoC Rust project. This can help overcome potential contribution barriers caused e.g. by an using an unsupported operating system or not having performant enough hardware.
