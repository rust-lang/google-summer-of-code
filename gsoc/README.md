# Google Summer of Code
The Rust Project has decided to join the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program for the first time in 2024.

Runs:
- **2025** (currently active): [accepted projects](runs/2025.md), [blog post announcement](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2025/05/08/gsoc-2025-selected-projects).
- **2024**: [accepted projects](runs/2024.md), [blog post announcement](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/05/01/gsoc-2024-selected-projects.html), [results](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/11/07/gsoc-2024-results.html).

If you would like to participate in GSoC, please take a look at the [proposal guide](proposal-guide.md), which should help you prepare your GSoC proposals.

**Please do not harrass and/or spam Rust Project members and mentors, or other members of the Rust community! If you do so, we will not consider your proposal. It is fine to send a direct message (DM) to a mentor that you want to communicate with, but do not spam multiple people with DMs, asking them to be a mentor for your project proposal! Post a topic in some Zulip stream instead.**

The Rust Project can provide remote access to powerful cloud-based [Linux machines](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/docs/dev-desktop.html) to contributors that will be accepted for a GSoC Rust project. This can help overcome potential contribution barriers caused e.g. by an unsupported operating system or not performant enough hardware.
